# Basic-Data-Structures-Projects
These are projects to practice the implementation of some basic data structures, such: Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues and Heaps, Sets, Maps, Hash Tables, and some String Algorithms.

The ide is the development of intutive user interfaces and easy management.

1.- Social Net System: Core sections could be: 
  •	Users Management
  •	Posts (Publications)
  •	Comments and Likes
  •	Friends (Particular Net). 

  Summary of Integrated Data Structures:
    •	Queues: Activity notifications.
    •	Priority Queues (Heaps): Highlighting of the most relevant publications.
    •	Sets: To manage the "Likes" and list of friends.
    •	Maps/Dictionarys: To organize every user's info.
    •	Linked Lists: To store user posts.
    •	Strings Algorithms: For efficient users and posts seaching.

2.- Hospital Management System: Core Sections could be: 
  • Patient and Doctor Information Management 
  • Appointments and Notifications 
  • Medical Records and History 
  • Search and Filter Functionality

  Summary of Integrated Data Structures: 
    • Queues: For notifications of new appointments, test results, and reminders. 
    • Priority Queues (Heaps): To prioritize patients based on the severity of their conditions. 
    • String Algorithms: For efficient searches of patients or doctors by name, ID, or key symptoms. 
    • Sets: To manage medical specialties and patient allergies. 
    • Maps/Dictionarys: To store detailed information for each patient and doctor. 
    • Linked Lists: To record treatments, consultations, and test results in each patient's history.

3.- Digital Library Management System: Core Sections could be: 
  • Book Management 
  • User Management 
  • Loans and Returns 
  • Search and Notifications

  Summary of Integrated Data Structures: 
    • Queues: To handle notifications to users about reservations, due dates, and book availability. 
    • Priority Queues (Heaps): To prioritize books by popularity (number of reservations) and requests. 
    • String Algorithms: For efficient searches of books by title, author, or keywords. 
    • Sets: To manage book categories and genres. 
    • Maps/Dictionarys: To organize detailed information about each book and user. 
    • Linked Lists: To manage records of loans and each user's history.
