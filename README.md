# Basic-Data-Structures-Projects
These are projects to practice the implementation of some basic data structures, such: Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues and Heaps, Sets, Maps, Hash Tables, and some String Algorithms.

The idea is the development of intutive user interfaces and their easy management.

**User interfaces should be very intuitive and should constantly demonstrate the use of data structures as the user navigates the system.**

In this repository you will find 3 possible projects. 
The files contains a brief explanation in spanish and they are only showing some idea about what of the contains are expected. Obviously, they are just a mere so basic example. The developer need to make a beautiful and practical user interface capacble of showing how the datastructures are helping in the management of the system.

## 1.- Social Net System: Core sections could be: 
  *	Users Management
  *	Posts (Publications)
  *	Comments and Likes
  *	Friends (Particular Net). 

  ### Summary of Integrated Data Structures:
    *	Queues: Activity notifications.
    *	Priority Queues (Heaps): Highlighting of the most relevant publications.
    *	Sets: To manage the "Likes" and list of friends.
    *	Maps/Dictionarys: To organize every user's info.
    *	Linked Lists: To store user posts.
    *	Strings Algorithms: For efficient users and posts seaching.

## 2.- Hospital Management System: Core Sections could be: 
  * Patient and Doctor Information Management 
  * Appointments and Notifications 
  * Medical Records and History 
  * Search and Filter Functionality

  ### Summary of Integrated Data Structures: 
    * Queues: For notifications of new appointments, test results, and reminders. 
    * Priority Queues (Heaps): To prioritize patients based on the severity of their conditions. 
    * String Algorithms: For efficient searches of patients or doctors by name, ID, or key symptoms. 
    * Sets: To manage medical specialties and patient allergies. 
    * Maps/Dictionarys: To store detailed information for each patient and doctor. 
    * Linked Lists: To record treatments, consultations, and test results in each patient's history.

## 3.- Digital Library Management System: Core Sections could be: 
  * Book Management 
  * User Management 
  * Loans and Returns 
  * Search and Notifications

  ### Summary of Integrated Data Structures: 
    * Queues: To handle notifications to users about reservations, due dates, and book availability. 
    * Priority Queues (Heaps): To prioritize books by popularity (number of reservations) and requests. 
    * String Algorithms: For efficient searches of books by title, author, or keywords. 
    * Sets: To manage book categories and genres. 
    * Maps/Dictionarys: To organize detailed information about each book and user. 
    * Linked Lists: To manage records of loans and each user's history.
